<p>Sonoma County is beautiful and relaxing place to spend a weekend, but August is peak season so please be aware rooms book quickly.  After looking at all of the options, we reserved a block of rooms at the Flamingo Resort and Spa in Santa Rosa. The rooms are a good size and the hotel has a nice pool which is the perfect place to relax and catch up with friends and family (full disclosure the parking lot approach belies the rest of the property). The Flamingo Hotel is about a 15 minute drive from Beltane Ranch, which is in the town of Glen Ellen, making it a more affordable option than hotels closer to the venue. We will provide transportation to the wedding, but if you don't like the idea of being beholden to a bus schedule, Uber and Lyft run on the area and there are also a number of local taxi services. <p>

<p>If you are looking for a more up scale experience The Olea is a lovely boutique hotel in Glen Ellen, and only a couple of miles from Beltane Ranch.</p>

If you would like to stay right in the heart of downtown Sonoma without spending a fortune, The Sonoma Hotel is a small Inn right on the square. The rooms are quaint but on the smaller side. Be aware that the hotel does not have an elevator and all rooms are on the upper floors. The Sonoma Hotel is about 7 miles from Beltane Ranch. We have rooms reserved there, but they will release them 90 days before the wedding date. </p>
