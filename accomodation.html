	<p>Sonoma County is beautiful and relaxing place to spend a
	  weekend, but August is peak season so please be aware that
	  rooms book quickly. After looking at all of the options, we
	  reserved a block of rooms at both the Flamingo Resort and
	  Spa and Hotel La Rose in Santa Rosa. The Flamingo has a nice
	  pool which is the perfect place to relax and catch up with
	  friends and family. Hotel la Rose has a quaint historic vibe
	  and within walking distance of some shops and
	  restaurants. Santa Rosa is about a 20 minute drive from
	  Beltane Ranch. We will provide transportation from both
	  hotels to the wedding, but if you don't like the idea of
	  being beholden to a bus schedule, Uber and Lyft run in the
	  area and there are also a number of local taxi
	  services.  <p>

If you would like to stay in the heart of downtown Sonoma without spending a fortune, The Sonoma Hotel is a small Inn right on the square. The rooms are quaint but on the smaller side. Be aware that the hotel does not have an elevator and all rooms are on the upper floors. The Sonoma Hotel is about 7 miles from Beltane Ranch. We have rooms reserved there, but they will release them 90 days before the wedding date. </p>

Airbnb and VRBO are both great options to find an interesting alternative to a standard hotel.
