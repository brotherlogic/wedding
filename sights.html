<p><b>Wine Tasting:</b> There is no shortage of wine tasting opportunities in Sonoma. Here are a couple of our favorites. Most places require reservations so best to do some research and make appointments in advance.</p>

<p>
<b>Hiking:</b> Trione-Annadel State Park and Jack London State Park are both near by and have lots of trails to explore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Downtown Sonoma:</b> Downtown Sonoma is a cute small town with a number of local shops and restaurants around the central square. If you enter the address for Sonoma Plaza into your GPS, 453 1st St E, Sonoma, CA 95476  ,you'll end up in the heart of town.
</p>

<p>
<B>Di Rosa Center of Contemporary Art:</b> The Di Rosa Center of Contemporary Art is Gallery and large outdoor sculpture park. The gallery is nice, but the real treat is the outdoor sculpture park, and you can only tour the sculpture park as part of the scheduled tours, so make sure to check the scheduled tour hours in advance. Di Rosa is about a 30 in drive from Beltane Ranch.
